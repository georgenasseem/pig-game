# Pig Game 

#### This project was built when I was learning JavaScript, I am adding it here to host it for free on github. This is a very baisic game, many people know it as pig game. The game requires 2 players and 5 minuets of your free time. Information about the rules, running the game, and contribution are listed down below.

## Rules
#### This game involves 2 players. Your goal is to reach 100 points before your opponent does. Each time you roll a dice the number is added to your current score, you can roll as many times as you want until you decide you want to save all your current score and add it to your total score, but becareful because rolling a 1 will end your turn and you wont get any of your current points.

## Running the game
Running the game is very simple. It is hosted by Github Pages for free. You can run the project [here](https://georgenasseem.github.io/pig-game/)
